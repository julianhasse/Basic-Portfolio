Dogs – My American Pit Bull Terrier, Sophia, is a service-dog drop out. Sophia was raised by my wife, and now I´m in charge of her senior years.
Music – I own and play several instruments and enjoy building guitars from scratch.
Home Improvement – I get a lot of satisfaction out of home improvement projects. I built my own guitar workshop.
Car Wax – I get inordinate amount of satisfaction from car detailing. I actually enjoy all aspects of detailing, but I especially enjoy car wax. Rumors have circulated that I have even made my own brand of car wax!
